SYMLINK ISSUES:
1.
Java (and therefore ant) under cygwin does not understand symlinks. As part of the build process, all symlink targets are copied over their respective symlinks with a call to:
batfish_replace_symlinks

To undo this (e.g. before a commit), run:
batfish_restore_symlinks

2.
It is suggested that the following lines be added to ~/.gitconfig to avoid other symlink / windows-line-ending issues:

[core]
   symlinks = true
   autocrlf = false
